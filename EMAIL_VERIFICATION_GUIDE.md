# Email Verification Feature

This document explains the email verification feature that has been added to your Flutter healthy app.

## Overview

The email verification feature ensures that users verify their email addresses before they can access the app. This is implemented using Firebase Authentication's built-in email verification functionality.

## How It Works

### 1. User Registration Flow
1. User fills out the registration form
2. App creates a Firebase Auth account
3. **NEW**: Automatically sends a verification email to the user
4. User is redirected to the Email Verification Screen
5. User must verify their email before accessing the app

### 2. User Sign-In Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. App attempts to sign in with Firebase Auth
3. **NEW**: If email is not verified, sign-in is blocked with an error message
4. User is shown a dialog with option to go to verification screen
5. Only verified users can access the dashboard

### 3. Email Verification Screen
- Shows the user's email address
- Provides a "I've Verified My Email" button to check verification status
- Includes a "Resend Verification Email" button
- Automatically checks verification status every 3 seconds
- Once verified, user is automatically redirected to the dashboard

### 6. `lib/main.dart`
- **Modified**: `AuthWrapper` now checks email verification status
- **Added**: Routes to email verification screen for unverified users

## User Experience

### For New Users:
1. Register → Receive verification email → Verify → Access app

### For Existing Unverified Users:
1. Try to sign in → See verification dialog → Go to verification screen → Verify → Access app

### For Verified Users:
1. Sign in → Access app immediately (no change in experience)

## Firebase Configuration

No additional Firebase configuration is required. The email verification feature uses Firebase Authentication's built-in functionality.

## Testing the Feature

1. **Test Registration**:
   - Register a new account
   - Check that verification email is sent
   - Verify that user is redirected to verification screen

2. **Test Sign-In with Unverified Email**:
   - Try to sign in with unverified account
   - Verify that sign-in is blocked
   - Check that verification dialog appears

3. **Test Email Verification**:
   - Click verification link in email
   - Return to app and click "I've Verified My Email"
   - Verify that user is redirected to dashboard

4. **Test Resend Verification**:
   - Click "Resend Verification Email"
   - Check that new email is sent

## Security Benefits

1. **Email Ownership Verification**: Ensures users own the email addresses they register with
2. **Reduced Spam Accounts**: Makes it harder to create fake accounts
3. **Account Recovery**: Verified emails enable secure password reset functionality
4. **Communication Channel**: Ensures the app can reliably communicate with users

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- Firebase Auth errors
- Email sending failures
- User state changes

All errors are displayed to users with clear, actionable messages.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Email verification reminder notifications
2. Customizable verification email templates
3. Phone number verification as an alternative
4. Social media authentication with email verification
5. Admin panel to manage user verification status
